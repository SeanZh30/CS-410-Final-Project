it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\r\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\r\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\r\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\r\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time .

changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\r\npipeline allows this change . \"\r\nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\r\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\r\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\r\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\r\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\r\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\r\nin case it causes problems with their\r\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\r\nthe unify team .\r\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\r\nmarket east - but not from\r\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\r\nthe same legal entity .\r\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\r\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\r\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\r\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\r\nwere locked down for a reason .\r\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\r\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\r\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\r\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\r\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\r\nunify .\r\n- -

it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\r\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\r\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\r\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\r\nin case it causes problems with their\r\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\r\nthe unify team .\r\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena -

beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\r\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\r\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\r\nwere locked down for a reason .\r\nif you invalidate a service deal -

{"label": 1, "text": "Subject: reply soon ! ! !\r\ndear sir ,\r\ni know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the\r\nonly secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business .\r\nit is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and\r\nassistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am\r\ndr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former\r\nmilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )\r\nwho died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as\r\ni was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,\r\nhence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .\r\ni have lost confidence with anybody within the country .\r\nhaving noted the confidence reposed on your person ,\r\ni became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving\r\nthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general\r\n( my husband ) .\r\nthis money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have\r\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for\r\nsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to\r\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .\r\nit is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my\r\norganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this\r\norganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .\r\non your acceptance to render this assistance to me\r\nto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\r\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\r\nnon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\r\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\r\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\r\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\r\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\r\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\r\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\r\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\r\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\r\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\r\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\r\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\r\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\r\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\r\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\r\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\r\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\r\nto my full assistance and unlimited\r\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\r\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\r\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\r\nsins\r\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\r\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\r\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\r\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\r\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\r\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\r\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\r\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\r\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\r\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\r\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\r\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\r\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\r\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\r\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\r\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\r\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\r\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\r\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\r\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\r\nco - operation highly confidential .\r\nbest wishes ,\r\nmrs . mariam abacha .\r\n", "index": 1393}

{"label": 0, "text": "Subject: california energy crisis\r\ncalifornia \u0001 , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several\r\nmonths . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we\r\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .\r\nplease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation\r\nand our position on california energy issues .\r\nwhat happened in california\r\nthe source of california \u0001 , s current problem is as straightforward as supply\r\nand demand . california \u0001 , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased\r\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory\r\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so\r\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,\r\npredictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10\r\npercent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\r\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related\r\nfactors that led to the current crisis . first , the state \u0001 , s regulations\r\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for\r\npower is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market\r\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long\r\nterm , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in\r\ncalifornia , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the\r\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the\r\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine\r\nwhile the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt\r\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\r\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained\r\nin effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep\r\ncompetition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale\r\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the\r\nregulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\r\nin short , california \u0001 , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .\r\nregulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new\r\ngeneration from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile\r\nspot prices .\r\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned\r\nthe state \u0001 , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,\r\nif adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\r\nenron \u0001 , s role\r\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix\r\nthe problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the\r\npoliticians and the media . here are the facts :\r\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the\r\nstate of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the\r\nsame market available to other california purchasers . because we are a\r\nmarket maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are\r\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products\r\nfor our customers .\r\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from\r\nthe problems the states \u0001 , utilities , and their customers , now face . we\r\nprotected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\r\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply\r\npower directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on\r\nthe open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001 enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron\r\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western\r\npower markets . enron \u0001 , s primary business is managing risk for our customers\r\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more\r\ndemand for our products and services .\r\nthe solution\r\nthe solution to california \u0001 , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the\r\nstate must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market\r\nand shore up the financial stability of the state \u0001 , s utilities .\r\nincreasing supply\r\ncalifornia \u0001 , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing\r\nshort of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less\r\nthan a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply\r\nmust streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations\r\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the\r\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and\r\ndisplacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can\r\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new\r\nfacilities .\r\nreducing demand\r\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .\r\nthey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail\r\nmarket would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand\r\nat lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\r\nreducing reliance on the spot market\r\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from\r\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer\r\nterm , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands\r\nof the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .\r\nopening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their\r\nprice risk .\r\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state \u0001 , s institutions\r\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to\r\ngreater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to\r\narrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover\r\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and\r\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is\r\nneeded .\r\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,\r\nwhile politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters\r\nworse . price caps have been proposed . they don \u0001 , t work ; have never worked ;\r\nand they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,\r\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how\r\nineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it\r\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley\r\nor silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current\r\nshortage worse .\r\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in\r\ncalifornia . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that\r\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,\r\nconstructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in\r\ncalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power\r\ngeneration - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads\r\nand other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\r\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the\r\ncrisis from the media , it \u0001 , s important for you to know this : we at enron will\r\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real\r\nsolutions to the state .", "index": 2106}

enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline\r\npipeline systems :\r\nsummary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the\r\nname of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %\r\nenron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading\r\non the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in\r\nthe process of being drafted .\r\nenron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to\r\nsupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand\r\nthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps\r\nscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st\r\nfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen\r\ncenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv\r\nwill start in early february for march production .\r\nto do ' s :\r\naccounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it\r\ntransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next\r\nmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same\r\npage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .\r\npc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my\r\nrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .\r\nnetworks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the\r\nvoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot\r\nis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a\r\ncombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been\r\nrequested .\r\nlocation on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from\r\nfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .\r\ncurrently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall\r\ncubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall\r\ncubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .\r\ndata conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and\r\nmeter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin\r\ntrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump\r\nof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .\r\nwe also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need\r\nto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the\r\nsystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know\r\nwho else will need access .\r\ninterface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada\r\napplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright\r\nfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two\r\napplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .\r\nthere will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s\r\nrtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime\r\nthere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything\r\nis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between\r\npop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is\r\ncomplete .\r\nscada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to\r\nenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to\r\nthem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs\r\nby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best\r\ndone as a part of the scada transition .\r\naccounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be\r\nbetter defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this\r\nprocess started .\r\nhourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be\r\nbilled on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk\r\nthrough this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least\r\ninitially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the\r\nbilling for this one customer .\r\nplease let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have\r\nmy assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached\r\nat 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy", "index": 2132}

p\r\nas many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\r\nprice because they are promoted , making a very large number of\r\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\r\nlet ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\r\notc : dmxpp\r\nabout the company : p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\r\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\r\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\r\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\r\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\r\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\r\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\r\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\r\nfound in north america . p\r\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\r\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\r\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\r\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\r\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\r\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\r\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\r\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\r\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\r\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\r\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\r\nmoves forward . p\r\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\r\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\r\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\r\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\r\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\r\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\r\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\r\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\r\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\r\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\r\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\r\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\r\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\r\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\r\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\r\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\r\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\r\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\r\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\r\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\r\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\r\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\r\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\r\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\r\nexploration is justified . p\r\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\r\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\r\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\r\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\r\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\r\nfinance additional exploration . p\r\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\r\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\r\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\r\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\r\nextensive exploration program . pp\r\n( source : company website ) p\r\nrecent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\r\nconference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\r\npreparation of work program . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\r\nexploration findings in south america . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\r\nexploration in south america . pp\r\nwill dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\r\nthe stock this weekend and next week ?

{"label": 0, "text": "Subject: new version of stack manager\r\nintroduction\r\nin response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have\r\nupgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we\r\nhope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your\r\nproducts .\r\nthis new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .\r\nplease ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .\r\nsummary of new features\r\nmultiple children - a \" child \" product can be the \" parent \" of another child\r\n( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed\r\nagainst a single parent .\r\nstatic product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and\r\nhit the \" + \" or \" - \" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount\r\nin product properties until you logout .\r\nsorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on\r\nthe title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your \" shift \" key .\r\nparent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis\r\nrelationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : \" basis\r\nlink - parent \" and now would say \" stand alone , parent \" ) .\r\ndetailed feature descriptions\r\nmultiple children\r\nthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together\r\nin a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product\r\nb , which is in turn linked to parent product c .\r\nwarning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a\r\nchain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a\r\ncustomer attempts a transaction , the database must \" lock \" each and every\r\nproduct in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the\r\ndatabase must then update the stack for each product before releasing the\r\nlocks . \" vertical \" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are\r\nmuch slower to process than \" flat \" chains ( one parent with many children ) .\r\nlarge vertical chains should be avoided .\r\nrelated to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the\r\nsame parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent\r\nproduct b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link\r\nto the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated\r\nbasis link and a regular basis link .\r\nstatic product bar prices\r\nthe new version of enrononline provides for \" sticky \" product bar price and\r\nvolume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not\r\nreset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you\r\nhave logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or\r\noffsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the \" + \" or \" - \" buttons .\r\none of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it\r\nreduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if\r\nthe price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price\r\nmovement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the\r\nwebsite to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder\r\nfor customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update\r\nmoves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering\r\nan appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price\r\nmovement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,\r\nimproving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure\r\nrate .\r\nyou may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field\r\nfor offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products\r\nwhich have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .\r\nsorting / selecting\r\nthe new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting\r\nfunctionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,\r\nlocation , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple\r\nsorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then\r\nlocation while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first\r\nby product type and then within each product type , by location ( in\r\nalphabetical order ) .\r\nif you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort\r\ncriteria , plus you can select \" sort by web order \" , which allows you to see\r\nyour products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the\r\nwebsite ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a\r\nnumber of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .\r\nwhen you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left\r\nmouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while\r\nmaking your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not\r\nnecessarily adjacent to one another .\r\nparent products and f / x products\r\none of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its\r\ntreatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the\r\ntype of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of\r\nthe main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version\r\ndoes not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for\r\nmore than one type of link on each parent product .\r\nsome traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now\r\nidentified with a stylised \" fx \" in the product list . this is to enable easy\r\nidentification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the\r\nparent , rather than managed individually .\r\nassistance\r\nas always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,\r\nplease contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )\r\n20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .\r\ngeneral feedback\r\nif you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further\r\nfunctionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had\r\npreviously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this\r\nrelease , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard\r\nto improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your\r\nrequests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .", "index": 2258}

{"label": 0, "text": "Subject: new enrononline functionality\r\nin order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .\r\nstack manager changes\r\ntop of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\r\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected .\r\nplease note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .\r\nrestricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\r\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as restricted top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \" restricted top of stack \" feature .\r\nadvanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" all \" option from the drop down box .\r\nwebsite changes\r\nnew submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .\r\nthe submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .\r\nprice of limit orders\r\nmodify limit orders\r\ncustomers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the \" today ' s orders \" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the \" set \" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .\r\nexpiration time for limit orders\r\ncustomers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .\r\nfloat the today ' s orders section\r\nyou can now float the \" limit order \" section . in order to do so , right click in the \" today ' s orders \" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window \" stay on top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .\r\nmid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .\r\nin order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .\r\nchanges to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .\r\nplease note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .\r\nif you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 -

{"label": 0, "text": "Subject: california energy crisis\r\ncalifornia ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\r\nwhat happened in california\r\nthe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\r\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\r\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\r\nin short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\r\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\r\nenron ' s role\r\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\r\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\r\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\r\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \" turnback \" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\r\n? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\r\n? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\r\n? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\r\nenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\r\nthe solution\r\nthe solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .\r\nincreasing supply\r\ncalifornia ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\r\nreducing demand\r\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\r\nreducing reliance on the spot market\r\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\r\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions\r\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\r\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\r\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\r\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .", "index": 2306}

one quarter section spacing ( 160\r\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\r\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\r\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\r\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\r\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\r\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\r\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\r\ngeological discussion\r\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\r\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\r\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\r\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\r\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\r\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\r\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\r\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\r\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\r\nproduction facilities discussion\r\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\r\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\r\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\r\nconstructed .\r\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\r\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\r\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\r\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\r\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\r\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\r\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\r\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\r\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\r\noil product to the transportation system .\r\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\r\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\r\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\r\nconclusion :\r\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\r\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ;

why do all the\r\ninternational lines except russia fly american\r\nplanes ? why does no other land on earth even\r\nconsider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you\r\ntalk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .\r\nyou talk about german technocracy , and you get\r\nautomobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,\r\nand you find men on the moon - not once , but several\r\ntimes - and safely home again .\r\nyou talk about scandals , and the americans put\r\ntheirs right in the store window for everybody to\r\nlook at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued\r\nand hounded . they are here on our streets , and most\r\nof them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are\r\ngetting american dollars from ma and pa at home to\r\nspend here .\r\nwhen the railways of france , germany and india were\r\nbreaking down through age , it was the americans who\r\nrebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the\r\nnew york central went broke , nobody loaned them an\r\nold caboose . both are still broke .\r\ni can name you 5000 times when the americans raced\r\nto the help of other people in trouble . can you name\r\nme even one time when someone else raced to the\r\namericans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was\r\noutside help even during the san francisco\r\nearthquake .\r\nour neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one\r\ncanadian who is damned tired of hearing them get\r\nkicked around . they will come out of this thing\r\nwith their flag high . and when they do , they are\r\nentitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are\r\ngloating over their present troubles . i hope canada\r\nis not one of those . \"\r\nstand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !\r\nthis is one of the best editorials that i have ever\r\nread regarding the united states . it is nice that\r\none man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of\r\nthe world would realize it . we are always blamed for\r\neverything , and never even get a thank you for the\r\nthings we do .\r\ni would hope that each of you would send this to as\r\nmany people as you can and emphasize that they\r\nshould send it to as many of their friends until\r\nthis letter is sent to every person on the web . i am\r\njust a single american that has read this , tribute to\r\nthe united states\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ?

{"label": 0, "text": "Subject: tenaska iv gas\r\ndaren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and\r\nwilliams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few\r\nitems i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was\r\ncancelled ) :\r\n1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should\r\nhave been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )\r\nand not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -\r\n230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at\r\n2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .\r\n2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged\r\n$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91\r\nprice , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at\r\n2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .\r\ni reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for\r\n2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment\r\nif delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and\r\nincrease by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at\r\n. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .\r\nin reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price\r\nis 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache\r\ninvoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at\r\nother places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if\r\nenron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a\r\nmargin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant\r\nshould not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .\r\nlooking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and\r\noctober , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from\r\nwilliams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot\r\nprices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our\r\nmeeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of\r\n$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas\r\ndelivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .\r\nso based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their\r\nnovember invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price\r\ndifferences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of\r\n$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of\r\ntenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .\r\nmonth plant gas price amount\r\nnovember 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843\r\nnovember adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )\r\noctober adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )\r\nnov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000\r\nsept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52\r\ntotal $ 484 , 234 . 03\r\ni discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before\r\nreaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts\r\nthat i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .\r\njames", "index": 3134}

' '\r\nenbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .\r\nthe intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .\r\nit forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .\r\nenbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .\r\nthird quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .\r\n\" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , \" said tutcher . \" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

just\r\nin case it causes problems with their\r\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\r\nthe unify team .\r\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\r\nmarket east - but not from\r\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\r\nthe same legal entity .\r\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\r\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\r\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\r\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\r\nwere locked down for a reason .\r\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\r\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\r\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\r\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\r\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\r\nunify .\r\n- -

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\r\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\r\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\r\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\r\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .", "index": 3304}
