{"label": 1, "text": "Subject: please endeavour to use this for charity .\r\nfrom : mrs . ruth makary .\r\nplease endeavour to use this for charity .\r\ncalvary greetings ! !\r\nmy name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a\r\nnationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with\r\nkuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile\r\ncrash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .\r\nbefore his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive\r\nwe protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life\r\ninsurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance\r\ncompany . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the\r\npurpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of\r\naccrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund\r\nand the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but\r\nunfortunately he dies .\r\nrecently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer\r\nproblem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this\r\nsickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the\r\nbreaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved\r\nin an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december\r\n1999 .\r\nhaving known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate\r\nthis fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a\r\nchristian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to\r\ninstruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,\r\norphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to\r\nensure that the house of god is maintained .\r\ni took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit\r\nthis money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are\r\nnot christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by\r\nunbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in\r\nan ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .\r\ni am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is\r\nentitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .\r\nexodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my\r\npeace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .\r\nwith god all things are possible .\r\ni have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive\r\nyour reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the\r\ncontacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the\r\nfreezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process\r\nthe liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you\r\nto take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a\r\nreality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i\r\npray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .\r\ni want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i\r\nlived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord\r\nmust serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through\r\nyour life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other\r\npeople for this same purpose .\r\nplease assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in\r\nanyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always\r\nremember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you .\r\nremain blessed in the name of the lord .\r\nyours in christ ,\r\nmrs . ruth makary .\r\n", "index": 584}
