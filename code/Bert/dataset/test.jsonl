the\r\noptimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\r\nthe skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\r\nupstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\r\noperation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\r\noperations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\r\nskills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\r\nopportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\r\naccomplish this objective across n . america .\r\nwe have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the\r\npowder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for\r\nprocessing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the\r\ngulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\r\noperations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\r\nparty producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\r\nit is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\r\ncompetitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl

{"label": 1, "text": "Subject: message subject\r\nthink getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ?\r\nthink again !\r\nwe can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed .\r\nwe work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote .\r\nclick here now !\r\nnow that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search\r\nyields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review\r\nof the two systems .\r\ni have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,\r\nboth with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via\r\nan ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca\r\nadapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and\r\nsirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .\r\nthe bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in\r\nsound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel\r\nquality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more\r\nchannels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .\r\nafter careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have\r\nsaid . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and\r\nare streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its\r\noft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm\r\nhas an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored\r\ncomedy ) , and a few more \" experimental \" music channels which most will find\r\ntotally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular\r\n( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s\r\nno wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you\r\nbuy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .\r\nthe greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are\r\nthe staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the\r\ncorporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying\r\nin an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that\r\nmakes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up\r\nloud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .\r\nthis , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my\r\ncancelling xm .\r\nxm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent\r\nmusic and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept\r\nxm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no\r\nmatter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered\r\neverything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the\r\ntalk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the\r\nuseful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .\r\nxm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius\r\nalso has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .\r\nhowever , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all\r\nhave to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for\r\nthe house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where\r\nthe corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .", "index": 94}

( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get\r\nthis assigned ? i can find old\r\nnotes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let\r\nme know .\r\nlavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for\r\nena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .\r\nmidcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and\r\ndec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with\r\ntransport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it\r\nstands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i\r\nthought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .\r\nchannel industries pipeline - several issues here :\r\n1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left\r\nunpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed\r\nappropriately . someone\r\nneeds to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,\r\nthat were nominated for january .\r\n2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this\r\nissue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot\r\nallocate was is\r\nnot pathed and nominated .\r\n3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point\r\nspecific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203\r\n10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the\r\nrate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this\r\ntransaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in\r\ndec . who is this assigned to for jan ?\r\nhpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december\r\nand january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back\r\nnext week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .\r\npat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to\r\nthe present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can\r\nproceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned\r\nissues .\r\nhank eisenhours duties were split :\r\nmandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,\r\ndecember flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .\r\ncarlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all\r\noffsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey\r\nalso handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas\r\nfor december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .\r\nhpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for\r\npathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .\r\nhpl operational seems to be left unassigned .\r\ni think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks\r\nresponsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .", "index": 522}

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\r\ndear shareholder , addlrko\r\ni am writing to you today to\r\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\r\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\r\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\r\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\r\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\r\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\r\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\r\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\r\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\r\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\r\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\r\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\r\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\r\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\r\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\r\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\r\nlast week we announced that abdv\r\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\r\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\r\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\r\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\r\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\r\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\r\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\r\nyou may ask ; why the energy\r\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\r\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\r\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\r\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\r\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\r\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\r\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\r\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\r\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\r\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\r\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\r\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\r\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\r\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\r\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\r\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\r\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\r\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\r\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\r\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\r\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\r\nso what do we do with our\r\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\r\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\r\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\r\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\r\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\r\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\r\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\r\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\r\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\r\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\r\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\r\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\r\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\r\nby concentrating on a specific\r\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\r\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\r\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\r\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\r\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\r\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\r\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\r\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\r\nfine wein records , inc .\r\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\r\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\r\ncorporation , inc .
